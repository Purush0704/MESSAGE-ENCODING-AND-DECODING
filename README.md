# MESSAGE-ENCODING-AND-DECODING

Message Encoding & Decoding â€“ The Concept of the project is to secure your information by Encoding the messages. Message encoding and decoding is the process to first convert 
the original text to the random and meaningless text called ciphertext. This process is called encoding. 

Decoding is the process to convert that ciphertext to the original text. This process is also called the Encryption-Decryption process. 

Here we have used Tkinter library which is used to design your very basic GUI for humans to be interactive enough with the code, instead of command line input and for the 
encoding and decoding part we used a library called base64 which provides a function to encode the binary data to ASCII characters and decode that ASCII characters 
back to binary data.
